## Explain like I am five

Imagine the Internet is a big zoo. All the animals in the zoo have numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4 instead of names. When you want to see an animal, you have to remember its number and go find it. That would be hard to remember!

Instead, the zoo has a special directory. The people who work at the zoo give all the animals fun names that are easy to remember, like "elephant" or "giraffe". But the animals still have numbers too. The directory helps you find the number for any animal name you type in.

The DNS is like the zoo directory. When you type a website name like "google.com" in your browser, DNS looks up the number for that website name. The number is called an "IP address" and it helps your computer find the right website. 

DNS works by asking different servers. It first asks a "root server" which tells it to ask a ".com server". The ".com server" then tells it to ask the "google server". The "google server" knows Google's IP address and sends that back. Then your computer can use that IP address to load Google's website.

Your browser and your computer each have a little directory too, so next time you want to go to Google they can remember the IP address and load the website faster without asking all the servers again.

So in summary, DNS is like a directory that turns easy-to-remember website names into hard-to-remember numbers (IP addresses) that your computer actually uses to find and connect to websites on the Internet.

Imagine the Internet is a massive library with billions of books. Each book has a call number like 753.8 or 910.4 instead of a title. When you want to find a book, you need to remember its call number and go search on that shelf.

That would be difficult so the library has something called a card catalog. The card catalog lets you search by book title. Under each title in the card catalog is the call number of that book.

The DNS is like the Internet's card catalog. When you type a website address like "google.com" in your browser, DNS looks up the "call number" for that website, which is called an IP address. The IP address tells your computer exactly where to find that website on the Internet.

DNS works by asking a series of computers called nameservers. It first asks a "root nameserver" which directs it to the ".com nameserver". The ".com nameserver" then tells it the nameserver for "google.com". Finally, the "google.com" nameserver provides Google's IP address.

Your browser and computer each keep a small catalog of recently looked up addresses, so the next time you visit Google they can go straight to its IP address without asking all the nameservers again.

In summary, DNS acts like the card catalog for the Internet. It converts website names that people can remember, like "google.com", into the IP addresses that computers need in order to actually locate and connect to websites. The DNS system of nameservers work together to translate names into IP addresses.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is an internet service that translates human-readable domain names into the IP addresses needed for locating and routing devices on the internet.

When you type a website address like "google.com" into your browser, your computer needs to figure out the numeric IP address of that website's server in order to actually connect to it. But no one can remember those long strings of numbers! That's where DNS comes in.

DNS works by using a hierarchical system of DNS servers. At the top is the root server, which contains information about the top-level domains like .com, .net, etc. When your computer makes a DNS request for google.com, it first goes to a root server to get directed to the .com DNS server.

The .com DNS server then contains information about which DNS server is authoritative for google.com. Your request then goes to the google.com DNS server, which contains the actual IP address for google.com's web servers. That IP address is then returned to your computer so it can connect to Google's website.

This all happens in milliseconds, behind the scenes when you type a domain name into your browser.

DNS servers cache responses for performance, so subsequent requests for the same domain name can be answered quickly from cache instead of traversing the entire DNS hierarchy again.

DNS uses a client-server model, with DNS resolvers acting as clients that query authoritative DNS servers to map domain names to IP addresses.

Recursion and recursion queries allow higher-level DNS servers to recursively resolve names on behalf of clients, traversing down the DNS hierarchy until they reach an authoritative DNS server for that domain.
